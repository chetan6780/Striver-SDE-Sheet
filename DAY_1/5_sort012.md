# Sort 0 1 2

### O(N log N) Time Complexity with sort function.

-   sort the vector using stl `sort()` function.

### O(N)+O(N) Time using counting sort.

-   count number of 0's, 1's, and 2's and push them in increasing order according to their frequency.

### O(N) Time, 3 Pointers, dutch national flag algorithm.

-   We take 3 pointers low, mid and high.
-   low and mid points to 0 while high points to the last element.
-   we assume following conditions.
    -   Towards the left of low everything is 0.
    -   Towards the right of high everything is 2.
    -   In between low and high, everything is 1.
-   while(mid<=high) we do following.
    -   When we encounter 0.
        -   we swap low and mid.
        -   we increment low and mid.
    -   When we encounter 1.
        -   we increment mid.
    -   When we encounter 2.
        -   we swap mid and high.
        -   we decrement high.

### Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
void sort012(int *arr, int n)
{
    int low = 0, mid = 0, high = n-1;
    while(mid<=high){
        switch(arr[mid])
        {
            case 0:
                swap(arr[low++],arr[mid++]);
                break;
            case 1:
                mid++;
                break;
            case 2:
                swap(arr[mid],arr[high--]);
                break;
        }
    }
}
```
